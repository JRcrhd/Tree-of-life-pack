After thousands of years of bloody struggle and intricate scheming, humanity finally drove out the gods who had shackled the Earth with absolute authority, and personally ushered in the "Dusk Epoch" that belongs to humanity.humanity finally regained the chance to look up and face the true starry sky that had never been glimpsed before. Countless mysteries concealed by divine power, hidden laws, elegant orders, and passionate possibilities all gradually revealed themselves through humanity's exploration.

Since then, the "Mystic Faction"—centered on reconstructing the essence of matter through alchemy, deducing the veins of time and space through divination, and linking heterogeneous beings through mediumship—has thrived alongside the "Technological Faction"—rooted in extending the limits of the human body with machinery, driving the operation of civilization with electricity, and deconstructing the world through precise calculations. The former touches the transcendental nature of the world in subtlety, while the latter builds the material framework of civilization through empirical evidence; together, they weave an unprecedented prosperity for human civilization.

Yet, ominous omens have emerged amid the rotation of constellations—the prophecy of doomsday lingers like a shadow. The "Midnight Epoch," which symbolizes the return of the gods' glory to shroud the earth once more, is slowly descending at the end of time and space. When the whispers of the gods resound in the universe again, the fire of civilization that humanity fought so hard to ignite will ultimately face the ultimate test of survival.
